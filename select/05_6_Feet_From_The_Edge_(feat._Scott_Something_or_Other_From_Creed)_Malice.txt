hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinkin
six feet aint so far down

i felt the touch of god
love of god
runnin lost
on the cross
with the cost
trust in something i never saw
they were gone for me
in way i pray to you i scream
i wanted things the way the way used to be
and got up off my nees
why wont you answer me crist
have you abandond me father
have you forsaken me
why were have you taken my daughter
ive had so many die
shes all i got left
let this be my song of sollem
man cause love is just as strong as death
nd i was runnin
how long you crush me with your words
told hem god wronged me
and closed his nit around my world
i thought you left me
but i turned my back on you
you let me
was just to test me
whats worst and then i cursed you
then you left me
trapped in this storm stepping on thorns
hand on my soal
battering a world of flesh on my own
i cannot pass this darkness in my path
the crown has been removed from my head
im six from the edge
old me now

hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking
maybe six feet aint so far down

hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking
maybe six feet aint so far down

fall into the dark just to dtraw the lost to the light looseing everything measns sa crifice
this life is onbly class
im dso behind on that
i need to find my path
retrace my travcks and go back
i took a second look
asbove atr earth continued my walk
i stoped and seen a seperate set of footstepsd in the dirt
i always find myself here
in trears where i started
3 years past
look at this church burned after the crash
moma im still thugin the world is a war zone
all my homies locked up
most of them dead gone
if you seen the way i see you
you would hold your head high
i kno w the waether seems hot
but youve got forty fucking... held by
if yio dont wanna die today
you dont give up i know
hope always seems its a thousand miles away
well get up to you feet
you have to continue
they depend on you
but above all else
youve gota love yourself and jessuse lives within you

hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking
maybe six feet aint so far down

hold me now
im six feet from the edge and im thinking
maybe six feet aint so far down
